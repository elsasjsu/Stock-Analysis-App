# Stock-Analysis-App
By processing the historical stock data, profit/loss reports can be generated. An embedded database management system will allow users to save and retrieve stock data. The system will use the Python libraries to create charts and get historical stock data from web sites. Students will learn how to use the GitHub platform for their project.
